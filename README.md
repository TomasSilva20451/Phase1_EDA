# Phase1_EDA

This GitHub repository contains code for a project in an introductory course on data analysis. The project involves analyzing the Carseats data set, which contains information on the sales of child car seats. The code includes a series of functions and scripts that allow the user to explore the data, visualize it, and build regression models to predict sales. Additionally, the code includes several scripts that allow the user to test and evaluate the models. This project is designed to help students gain a better understanding of the principles of data analysis.

built be a structure similar to this one and post in mine repository https://github.com/TomasSilva20451/EDA or provide al the codes in here comment by the name of the file , but you have to follow this rules in order to build  this a project.
Motivation
This individual assessment project for the Advanced Data Structures (EDA) course unit, integrated in the 2nd semester of the 1st year of the ESI / ESIPL / EIM / EEC / EDJD bachelor's degrees, aims to reinforce and apply the knowledge acquired throughout the semester.
Through this assessment project, it is intended to consolidate the knowledge related to the definition and manipulation of dynamic data structures in the C programming language.
The scope of this project lies in the development of a software solution in the area of micromobility. The growing ecosystem of new forms of social mobility, namely those that occur between short distances, has promoted the necessary integration of multiple means of transport. This transformation in the way mobility is carried out, an essential factor for the development of spaces, cities and others, will depend on actions that allow efficient use of transport means that support easier, faster, cleaner and cheaper mobility, such as electric mobility (scooters, bicycles, etc.).

Objective
This document should be seen as a reference for a classic approach to developing a software solution for a medium-sized problem. The essence of this project lies in the development of a software solution that allows the management (registration, sharing, use) of urban mobility means in a smart city context. The implementation of the solution should consider dynamic data structures, file storage, modularization and present adequate structuring and documentation.
Considering two types of users, namely managers and registered customers, the following functionalities are intended to be considered:
● Facilitate the rental of means of mobility, providing: information about the available means (type, battery charge, cost, etc.); identify the location of existing means through geocoding (what3words.com); register the payment through a rechargeable balance associated with the customer; among others;
● Allow the platform managers (managers) to manage their mobility means allowing to register, change, cancel, locate and other services;
● Admit only registered customers considering the NIF, balance, name, address, etc.;
● Allow platform managers the possibility of an integrated view allowing operations such as history queries, statistics, validations, etc.

Phase 1
1. Definition of a dynamic data structure (previously validated with the teacher) for the representation of electric mobility means, customers and managers;
2. Storage / reading of data in text (simulation values) and binary files (preserve data);
3. Insertion of new data (customer / manager / electric mobility means);
4. Removal of certain data (customer / manager / electric mobility means);
5. Change of certain data (customer / manager / electric mobility means);
6. Registration of the rental of a certain electric mobility means;
7. Listing of electric mobility means in descending order of autonomy;
8. Listing of electric mobility means existing in a location with a certain geocode.

For each phase, the work developed must be accompanied by:
● Source code documentation, with generation of the respective API (eg DoxyGen, DocX, others)
● Use of appropriate tools for version control (Git, GitHub, others).
● Use of appropriate tools for development management (Trello, others)

Final Note: The work must comply with the rules of good code structuring. They must use libraries, resort to the use of Patterns whenever they deem it advantageous, such as layered programming. Do not overuse interaction functions (reading / writing, menus). They must simulate values to demonstrate the application, resorting to values placed in text files.
